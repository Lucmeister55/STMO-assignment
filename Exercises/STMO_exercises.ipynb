    "#### Exercise: light refraction and Snell's law\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider two media with a different refraction index (e.g. air-water). A light beam is travelling from one point in the first medium the another point in the second medium. What will the relation between the incoming angles be for the two media. In other words, how will the light beam change direction? Solve this problem with the method of Lagrange multipliers."
